## [2026-02-08] — Patch Notes from the Void

```
$ git log --oneline -5
a3f7b2c fix: scanline overlay z-index collision
9e1d0aa feat: add terminal panel component
1bc4ef3 chore: purge dead CSS from the pre-punk era
8f2a91d fix: chromatic aberration was too aggressive on mobile
0d4c3e7 feat: initial site scaffold — we exist now
```

### What Shipped

- **subcult.tv v1.0** — You're looking at it. The site is live. The signal broadcasts.
- **Project index** — Auto-populated from GitHub, with manual overrides for the curated touch.
- **Effects system** — Three modes: Clean, Mild Glitch, Full VHS. Your CRT, your choice.
- **Zine engine** — MDX-powered posts with zine margins, glitch callouts, and terminal aesthetics.

### What Broke

- Mobile scanlines were rendering at 120fps. Phones were getting warm. Addressed.
- The chromatic aberration on h1 tags was causing headaches (literal). Toned down to `mild` by default.
- RSS feed was returning 418 (I'm a teapot). Still investigating.

> `[WARN] known issue: the void stares back. working on a fix.`

### What We Learned

1. CSS `clip-path` for torn edges is surprisingly performant
2. `prefers-reduced-motion` is not optional — it's the law
3. VHS tracking line animation needs to be subtle or it's nauseating
4. Monospace fonts hit different when everything else is serif

## [2026-01-20] — First Commit

```
$ echo "hello world" > index.html
$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "init: the void has been initialized"
```

The repository exists. The domain points somewhere. We have a `package.json` and a dream.

**Status:** Broadcasting test patterns. Stand by.
