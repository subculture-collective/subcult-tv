# SUBCULT Manifesto

> _"The signal does not ask permission to broadcast."_

---

## I. We Are the Static

We are not a company. We are not a brand. We are a signal embedded in the noise of the attention economy — a collective of builders, breakers, and broadcasters who refuse to be optimized.

**Subculture Collective** (SUBCULT) exists because the tools we needed didn't exist, and the ones that did were locked behind paywalls, surveillance stacks, and terms of service written by lawyers who've never touched a terminal.

So we built our own.

## II. What We Build

We build **tools for the counterculture**:

- Software that respects privacy by default
- Media tools that prioritize expression over engagement metrics
- Infrastructure that you own, on servers you control
- Documentation that reads like it was written by humans, not marketing departments

Every project starts with a question: _"Does this need to exist?"_ If the answer is yes, we ship it. If the answer is "someone already built this but it's bloated/proprietary/hostile," we ship it anyway.

## III. What We Won't Build

- Surveillance tools disguised as analytics
- Engagement traps masquerading as features
- Anything that requires you to surrender your data to use it
- Software that phones home

> `[SYSTEM] These are not guidelines. They are load-bearing walls.`

## IV. The Stack is a Séance

We believe in:

- **Open source** as a baseline, not a marketing strategy
- **Self-hosting** as an act of independence
- **Terminal-first workflows** because GUIs are somebody else's opinion
- **Ugly-beautiful design** that communicates rather than decorates
- **Shipping** over polishing. Version 0.1 beats a pitch deck.

## V. The Broadcast Continues

SUBCULT is funded by the people who use what we build. No venture capital. No ads. No exit strategy.

If you've read this far, you're already part of it.
