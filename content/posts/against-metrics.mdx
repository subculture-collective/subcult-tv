# Against Metrics

Measurement is necessary. Metrics are dangerous.

The distinction matters more than it seems.

Measurement helps us understand reality. Metrics often reshape it. When a number becomes a target, behavior reorganizes around it. This is not a moral failing. It is a predictable response to incentives.

If follower count determines perceived legitimacy, growth strategies will prioritize visibility over depth. If engagement rate becomes the benchmark, content will optimize for reaction over substance.

Metrics compress complexity into a single axis. They make comparison easy and competition inevitable.

The problem is not that numbers exist. The problem is that numbers simplify.

Consider cultural value. It includes trust, coherence, historical memory, internal norms, creative experimentation. None of these map cleanly onto a quantitative scale.

Yet platforms routinely present simplified dashboards: impressions, clicks, retention, conversion. These figures are not false. They are incomplete. And incomplete measures distort strategy.

Creators start interpreting flat metrics as flat meaning. Communities interpret fluctuations in visibility as fluctuations in worth.

> The metric becomes the narrative.

At Subculture Collective, we try to distinguish between metric and measure.

A metric compares you to others. A measure helps you understand yourself.

A metric says, "You grew by 12% this week."
A measure asks, "Did this growth align with your intention?"

Intentionality is the missing variable in most dashboards.

---

When growth becomes mandatory, sustainability erodes. The most emotionally charged content tends to outperform nuanced discussion. The metric rewards escalation. Over time, the culture bends toward whatever gets rewarded.

This is structural, not accidental.

Rejecting metrics entirely is not feasible. Organizations need feedback. The challenge is to design feedback systems that illuminate without pressuring.

What would a non-extractive dashboard look like?

It might foreground trends over rankings and contextualize anomalies rather than amplifying them. It would resist public leaderboards. It would treat numbers as diagnostic tools, not identity markers.

Most importantly, it would ask a question before presenting an answer: what are you trying to achieve?

Without clarity of purpose, metrics become external arbiters of value.

Culture is not a KPI. It is a living system. Measurement should serve that system, not reshape it into something more legible to advertisers.

When in doubt, ask whether a number increases understanding or increases pressure. If it does the latter without the former, it is misaligned.

Not everything that can be counted should count.
