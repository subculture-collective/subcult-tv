# How We Build: Tools, Servers, Rituals

> _Our stack is not a choice. It's a stance._

---

## The Workstation

Every SUBCULT project starts in a terminal. Not a browser. Not a Figma file. Not a Jira board. A terminal.

```
$ neofetch
  OS: Linux (btw)
  Shell: zsh + starship
  Terminal: WezTerm
  Editor: Neovim (no plugins is a lie, but we try)
  Font: JetBrains Mono
  Theme: Tokyo Night, modified until unrecognizable
```

We believe the terminal is the last honest interface. No dark patterns. No engagement loops. Just a cursor and your intent.

## The Stack

We don't have a "standard stack." We have principles:

### 1. Choose Boring Technology (Then Make It Weird)

- **Go** for backends — because goroutines are cheap and compilation is fast
- **TypeScript** for frontends — because `any` is a war crime
- **Rust** when we need to go fast and can't afford garbage collection
- **Bash** for the glue that holds everything together

### 2. Self-Host Everything You Can

We run our own:

- Git forges (Gitea, falling back to GitHub for public repos)
- CI/CD pipelines
- Monitoring and alerting
- DNS (yes, really)

> `[SYSTEM] external dependency count: as low as we can make it.`

### 3. Ship Fast, Fix Faster

Our deployment ritual:

```bash
# The SUBCULT deployment protocol
$ git push origin main        # push to main, no PRs for solo work
$ ssh box "cd /srv/app && git pull && make deploy"
$ curl -s https://subcult.tv | head -1  # smoke test
$ echo "it lives"             # or it doesn't, and we fix it
```

No Kubernetes. No Terraform. No 47-step CI pipeline. Just `git push` and `make deploy`.

### 4. Document Like Someone Will Read It

Every project gets:

- A `README.md` that actually explains what the thing does
- A `CONTRIBUTING.md` if we want contributors
- Inline comments that explain _why_, not _what_
- A `CHANGELOG.md` written for humans

## The Rituals

### Naming Conventions

Projects are named like bands, not products. We don't do `SuperTool Pro v2.0`. We do _Dead Letter Drop_, _Signal // Noise_, _Blackout Radio_.

### Code Review

We review each other's code like we're editing a zine. Is it clear? Is it honest? Does it do what it says? Ship it.

### The 3 AM Rule

If you're debugging at 3 AM, you've already shipped a feature that's too complex. Simplify. Sleep. Try again.

## The Hardware

- **Primary:** Refurbished ThinkPads. Because new hardware is a scam.
- **Servers:** Bare metal where we can, VPS when we must, cloud only under duress.
- **Networking:** Tailscale mesh + WireGuard tunnels. Our network is our castle.

> `$ uptime`
> `14:23:07 up 847 days, 3:42, 1 user, load average: 0.12, 0.08, 0.03`

The machines don't stop. Neither do we.
