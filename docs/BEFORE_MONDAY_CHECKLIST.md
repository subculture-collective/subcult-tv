## Before Monday checklist (starting from “only the 7 articles exist”) ✅🧱

### Minimum viable goal by Monday morning

By Monday, you should have **a canonical home**, **a subscribe path**, **a support path**, and **a “talk to me” path**—even if everything is v0.

---

# 1) Choose + set the canonical home (pick the fastest)

* [ ] **Pick one canonical publishing home** (don’t overthink):

  * [ ] **GitHub repo + GitHub Pages** (fastest/cleanest for dev audiences)
  * [ ] Your existing site (if already easy to deploy)
* [ ] Create a `/papers` (or `/docs/papers`) folder and put the 7 markdown files there
* [ ] Add a **Series index page**: `The Subcult Papers — Season 0`

  * [ ] Ordered list of all 7 papers
  * [ ] “Start here” + 2–3 lines explaining what Subculture Collective is
* [ ] Add basic **navigation links** somewhere obvious:

  * [ ] Papers
  * [ ] Memo (newsletter)
  * [ ] Support (Patreon/Sponsors)
  * [ ] Invest (deck/contact)

---

# 2) Add the investor rails (v0 is fine)

You need these four links live before you start posting.

### A) Memo signup (newsletter)

* [ ] Create a newsletter/signup page (simple options: Buttondown/Substack/ConvertKit)
* [ ] Name it something like: **“Subcult Infrastructure Memo”**
* [ ] Create a `/memo` page that:

  * [ ] Says what subscribers get (monthly memo + major drops)
  * [ ] Includes the signup form/link

### B) “Invest” landing (even if minimal)

* [ ] Create `/invest` page with:

  * [ ] 5–8 bullet **project overview**
  * [ ] A short **“What we’re building / Why now / What’s next”**
  * [ ] A clear **contact method** (email + calendar link if you have it)

### C) Deck + one-pager (v0)

If you don’t have time for polished assets, do a v0 with Google Slides/Docs and export PDFs.

* [ ] Create **Deck v0 (8–12 slides)** and export PDF
* [ ] Create **One-pager v0** and export PDF
* [ ] Link both on `/invest`

### D) Metrics page (baseline)

* [ ] Create `/metrics` with *baseline* values (even zeros are fine if honest):

  * [ ] Newsletter subscribers: 0
  * [ ] Supporters: 0
  * [ ] Weekly “proof” shipped: 0
  * [ ] Next milestone date: ___
* [ ] Add note: “Updated weekly (Sundays).”

---

# 3) Add the support rail (Patreon can be professional)

* [ ] Create Patreon page + set tone as **membership/sponsorship**, not investing
* [ ] Create 3–4 tiers (simple, credible):

  * [ ] $5 Supporter
  * [ ] $15 Insider (includes full monthly memo)
  * [ ] $50 Sponsor (name credit)
  * [ ] $250 Partner (feedback/roadmap vote)
* [ ] Create `/support` page linking to Patreon with:

  * [ ] What support funds this month (very concrete)
  * [ ] What supporters get (early demos, memos, credits)
  * [ ] 1–2 lines of “why membership matters”

---

# 4) Package the papers for publishing

* [ ] Ensure each article has:

  * [ ] Title (H1)
  * [ ] Short intro (2–4 lines)
  * [ ] Section headers (skim-friendly)
  * [ ] Consistent footer CTA block (copy/paste)
* [ ] Create a standard footer (add to all 7):

  * [ ] Subscribe: `/memo`
  * [ ] Support: `/support`
  * [ ] Invest: `/invest`

---

# 5) Create Week 1 distribution assets (so posting is easy)

* [ ] Create a single **link hub** page (optional but helpful): `/links`

  * [ ] Papers index
  * [ ] Memo signup
  * [ ] Support
  * [ ] Invest
* [ ] Draft these posts now (so Monday isn’t improvisation):

  * [ ] **Monday soft-open post** (“Rails are live. Season 0 starts Tuesday.”)
  * [ ] **Tuesday paper announcement** (short + 1 CTA)
  * [ ] **Thursday demo teaser** (even if demo comes later)
* [ ] Create 1 reusable **post header image** (simple is fine): logo + “Subcult Papers”
* [ ] Add OpenGraph/social metadata if possible (optional)

---

# 6) Tracking (so you can prove momentum)

* [ ] Create UTM links for the 3 primary CTAs:

  * [ ] `/memo`
  * [ ] `/support`
  * [ ] `/invest`
* [ ] Add basic analytics (lightweight is fine) OR at minimum:

  * [ ] Track newsletter subs + Patreon count weekly in `/metrics`

---

# 7) Dry run (do this Sunday night)

* [ ] Click through from a private/incognito window:

* [ ] Papers index → Paper #1 → memo signup
* [ ] Papers index → support page → Patreon
* [ ] Invest page → deck PDF opens → contact method works
* [ ] Confirm all links work on mobile
* [ ] Confirm the CTA footer appears on every paper
